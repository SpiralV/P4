# P4 "FallBall" game (Unity/Visual Studio)

## Saturday

#### Installfest

Got set up with visual studio, github, unity hub. <br />
Started following along with a purely cs tutorial, but found a combination beginner cs + Unity tutorial video that I started tonight and will finish Sunday. Sunday I will also spend time in Unity to see how far I will need to reign in scope.

#### C Sharp and Unity Basics

Followed along with a coding video and some Unity tutorials to get a grasp of things. C# is proving to be kinda sorta JS, and Unity just makes everything a lot easier than the ole JS/Canvas. They are also very flexible and intertwined perfectly. Visual Studio has its own quirks, I'm not sure why it uses things like different hotkeys than VS Code, and it's a lot more to look at, but I am gaining confidence quickly that I can make something even better than Project 1. I am still not sure quite yet, but I think I have the core concepts down at this point and I'm looking forward to creating.

### AM

Continued to work on Unity tutorials, stuff isn't very obvious to me trying to start on my own at this point, but it's going well, also have some general game ideas finalized

My idea is to have a player ball navigate a ball pit to get to the bottom. <br />

* different colored balls have different physical properties to make it difficult to navigate.
* plan to make at least 3 levels
* stretch goals include the timer, choosing player ball color, more than 3 levels, maybe some DB integration or something for best times

### PM

Made significant progress with some quirky holdups, such as windows encoding gitignores, and I'm feeling really comfortable with Unity now, I still am just finishing the tutorial game just to get comprehensive understanding so I can get out the game. I plan to finish the Unity tutorial video to understand a few other concepts this evening. I am very confident I can get a game created in the time I have left, Unity makes it about 100x easier than raw scripting, I'm feeling good!

## Tuesday

### AM 

As of this morning, I still had not really got anything going on the actual game, so I spent the morning gathering assets and setting up my first rough idea of a level. <br />

Things I still need are: <br />
* player movement
* other balls to have different physical properties 
* one more asset so there's a barrier to pass through for the player ball 
* some kind of effect when the bottom/goal/hole is reached.
* Title screen functionality
* Level complete functionality

Current Stretch Goals
* Some kind of ball generator perhaps, if randomizing  and limiting them isn't too much of a challenge. 
* Timer to track progress
* Add music to all screens
