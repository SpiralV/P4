## Saturday

#### Installfest

Got set up with visual studio, github, unity hub. <br />
Started following along with a purely cs tutorial, but found a combination beginner cs + Unity tutorial video that I started tonight and will finish Sunday. Sunday I will also spend time in Unity to see how far I will need to reign in scope. 

## Sunday

#### C Sharp and Unity Basics

Followed along with a coding video and some Unity tutorials to get a grasp of things. C# is proving to be kinda sorta JS, and Unity just makes everything a lot easier than the ole JS/Canvas. They are also very flexible and intertwined perfectly. Visual Studio has its own quirks, I'm not sure why it uses things like different hotkeys than VS Code, and it's a lot more to look at, but I am gaining confidence quickly that I can make something even better than Project 1. I am still not sure quite yet, but I think I have the core concepts down at this point and I'm looking forward to creating.
