# P4

## Saturday

### Installfest

Got set up with visual studio, github, unity hub. <br />
Started following along with a purely cs tutorial, but found a combination beginner cs + Unity tutorial video that I started tonight and will finish Sunday. Sunday I will also spend time in Unity to see how far I will need to reign in scope.
